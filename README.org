#+DESCRIPTION: AI-powered newsletter generation pipeline.

* Button2Beehiiv
An *automated content pipeline* that transforms a single button press into a newsletter ready for syndication 🚀

The system uses *multiple AI agents*, each specialized for a different task, orchestrated by a human Operator to produce high-quality, personality-driven newsletters.

Currently In Development:
- *Homelab Highlights:* a weekly roundup for the self-hosting and homelab community
- *The Nomad Nurses Dispatch:* a weekly newsletter for travel nurses

* Tech Stack
** LangFlow
Visual workflow builder
** Composio
Simplified API integration
** Beehiiv
Quick & easy newsletter platform
** Emacs/Org-mode
Documentation and prompt chain management

* Local Development
** Requirements
- OpenRouter API Key
- LangFlow
* Philosophy
** Wisdom Before Workflows
- Every component should be documented.
- Workflow must be able to be run *manually* without automation.
** Personality Over Polish
- Content should be thoughtful, engaging, and human-coded.
- Devs are encouraged to add some personality to the newsletters, within reason.
** Iterate and Improve
- Ship /something./ Quick, while no one's watching!
- Fix it later. (Probably no one will even notice.)
